Project Name: Rusty Roguelike

Story: The hero's hometown is suffering from a plague of monsters.
    Welling up from the deep, they seem unstopable.  Legend tells
    of the Amulet of Yala - Yet Another Lost Amulet - that can be
    used to stem the tide.  After a long night at the tavern, the
    hero promises to save the day and sets forth into the dungeon.

    6. Display a "game over" screen whtn the hero dies.
